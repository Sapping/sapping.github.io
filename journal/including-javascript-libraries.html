<p>I figured I&#39;d sit down and quickly add a navigation header to my site just to have it in place, so that I could add links to it later.</p>
<p>After reading over the Bootstrap documentation, I thought it seemed rather straight-forward, so I quickly whipped up a few lines of jade into a serviceable navigation header with a few link elements in it — one to the homepage and one to the blog portion.</p>
<p><em>(As a quick side note, I&#39;m really enjoying using jade, if only for the fact that it helps avoid the pesky problem of forgetting closing div and span tags.)</em></p>
<p>Satisfied with the look of the navigation header, I resized my browser and the navigation did indeed collapse just like the documentation advertised, and I was pretty pleased with how simple it had all been.</p>
<p>&quot;Just a matter of including the Bootstrap javascript libraries and any dependencies and we&#39;ll be all set.&quot; I thought to myself. So I downloaded the compiled javascript files provided by bootcamp and added them to a folder in my harp server directory, and appended these two lines near the top of my layout.jade document at the root of my server.</p>
<pre><code>script(src=&quot;/js/bootstrap.min.js&quot;)
script(src=&quot;//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.1/jquery.min.js&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>&quot;Simple,&quot; I thought &quot;the precompiled Bootstrap css is right on my server and the jquery is just served by Google&#39;s CDN.&quot;</p>
<p>But when I ran the harp server command from the terminal, the supposedly now collapseable navigation — the navigation still didn&#39;t collapse. So of course my first thought was that I referencing an incorrect id in my layout.jade file, or that I was somehow calling a javascript plugin with the wrong name.</p>
<p>I carefully reread the documentation, cheking each id and plugin name. It seemed okay to me. Next, I searched for a separate source of documentation. I found a few articles and even a youtube video, but it really seemed like I had added the lines properly for the navigation header to work.</p>
<p>Finally, I figured I&#39;d just comment out all my navigation code and shoehorn in Bootstrap&#39;s pure HTMl into my layout.jade. Aha! It didn&#39;t work either, so I gave my brain a dope-slap and checked out the two lines of code I had added earlier to include the necessary javascript libraries. I could see that my server was serving them correctly, because they were properly included in the page source. But, crucially, I had messed up the order in which I had added the two files. I quickly switched the order:</p>
<pre><code>script(src=&quot;//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.1/jquery.min.js&quot;)
script(src=&quot;/js/bootstrap.min.js&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>And suddenly everything was up and running as it should.</p>
<p>Lesson learned: Include javascript dependencies <em>before</em> the plugin file itself.</p>
<p><small> And also maybe don&#39;t work on code when I&#39;m sorely in need of some sleep. </small></p>
