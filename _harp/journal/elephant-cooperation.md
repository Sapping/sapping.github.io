# Elephants learn to cooperate

Despite the fact that elephants are known to be highly intelligent, little research has been done to test the extent of their cognitive abilities, primarily due to the size of the animals, which poses significant difficulties and dangers during the course of behavioural testing. Recently however, comparative psychologist [Joshua Plotnik](http://www.emory.edu/LIVING_LINKS/plotnik.html "Living Links Center, Emory University") modified a test previously performed on chimpanzees, in an effort to test the cooperative skills of Asian elephants. This experiment was conducted using twelve male and female elephants at the Thai Elephant Conservation Center in Lampang, Thailand.


##The Setup

Firstly, two separate lanes were built, one for each elephant, and a piece a rope was looped around the ends of a specially-built platform. Two bowls filled with corn were then rigged to the platform, and a volleyball net was stretched across both lanes to prevent the elephants from reaching the bowls. This forced the elephants to work together, each pulling their end of the rope at the same time, to get the treats. If only one elephant pulled on the rope, it would unwind from around the platform, thereby making it impossible for either elephant to gain access to the bowls of treats.


###The First Test

After learning that they both needed to pull at the same time to reach the food, the elephants were next released into the lane with a five second delay between the two. This meant that the first elephant had to wait for the second one to arrive before beginning to pull. As soon as the pair finished the trial successfully three consecutive times, the delay was increased to ten seconds, and so on all the way up to a twenty-five second delay. If on the other hand they failed three consecutive times, the elephants were set back to the previous delay.
Once the elephants were successful on the twenty-five second delay three consecutive times, the amount of tries needed to beat this first test were tallied. On average, the elephants took just over twenty-six tries to complete all of the trials. A perfect score would be fifteen attempts, three consecutive runs for each trial.


###The Second Test

The second test of the elephants’ ability to cooperate involved running the same experiment, but this time, half of the trials involved time periods ranging from twenty-five seconds all the way up to forty-five seconds. On the third day of testing, the only mistakes that were made were when two elephants weren’t patient enough on single attempts longer than twenty-five seconds, for a combined total of ninety-eight successful trials out of one hundred tries.


###The Third Test

For the third and final test, the researchers tied one end of the rope around a leg of the platform, making it impossible for one elephant to reach its end of the rope. This meant that neither elephant could pull the platform to within reach. The elephants realized this fact, often not even bothering to try, or turning away as soon as they realized that their partner couldn’t reach their end of the rope.


##Unique Solutions

During the three tests, two elephants devised solutions that the researchers hadn’t previously considered. One female named Neua Un used her foot to hold the rope so that her partner had to do all the work. JoJo, a male elephant didn't even bother to walk up to the platform unless his partner, Wanalee, was released. Instead of advancing towards the platform, he would wait for his partner at the release point.


##Conclusion

These results indicate that the elephants understood they needed help to complete the tests. They also understand the role that their partner plays in these tests, to the point of understanding that the platform is unattainable if their partner is unable to assist. This demonstrates that elephants have well-developed cooperative skill levels, on par with that of dolphins or chimpanzees.
