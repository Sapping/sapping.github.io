## Hosting

This site is hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) becasue it's free for personal sites and changes can easily be made by just pushing to the hosted [github repo](https://github.com/Sapping/sapping.github.io).

I also use [A Small Orange](https://asmallorange.com) for hosting some of my other work.

## Version Control Services
[Github](https://github.com/sapping) is where most of my public and private projects reside. I've previously used [Mercurial](https://www.mercurial-scm.org/), but I prefer using Git.

## Editors
[Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/intro/index.html) for Android app development, [Eclipse](https://eclipse.org) for Java, and [Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/3) for almost everything else.

## OS
For many years I preferred using Linux distros instead of other operating environments due to the limited hardware I had available at the time, finally settling on [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/). More recently, I've been dabbling with [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/), although most of my work is done on Windows 10 these days.
