Since I was little, I loved exploring what exactly makes things work the way they do. Because of this, I've been fixing and programming computers on my own and for others for over 7 years. My professional interests lie primarily in the field of computer science, and I'm looking to apply to a computer systems technician program.</p><p>Basically, I'm a software geek who loves tinkering with things and figuring out how they work. In my leisure time, I like to study architecture, roman history and nature, particularly insects and I am a voracious reader.</p></div></body><div id="footer"><p>Copyright &copy; Lucas Melin 2014</p></div></head></html>
